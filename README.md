`Next.js 7`

**DEVELOPMENT locally:**

`npm install` and `npm run dev`

**WORKING FLOW:**

- **ACTION TYPES:** There is a `constant folder`, inside that folder we will be creating all the action types.
- **ACTION CREATOR:** Since we are using redux saga as we don't need to create action creator folder, there is a saga folder already so create a feature wise folder and add those and make an entry in `appWatcher` function.
- **ACTION:** To create action, there is an already existing folder for that.
- **REDUCER** To create reducer, there is an already existing folder since make an entry by creating file name and map your reducer accordingly.
